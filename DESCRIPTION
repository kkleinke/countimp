Description: This package offers various solutions to multiply impute incomplete count data (ordinary, overdispersed, zero-inflated, multilevel).  All functions work as add-ons to the mice package (Multiple imputation using Fully Conditional Specification). Imputation models and methods are specified in mice, and the actual imputation process is done by mice.
